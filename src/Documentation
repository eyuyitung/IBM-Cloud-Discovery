==IBM Cloud Monitoring for Densify==

The purpose of this project is to test the possibility of collecting
metrics from IBM Virtual Server Instances (VSI) for Densify.

Key Terms:
    VSI = Virtual Service Instance (IBM name).
    SoftLayer = The User Interface of IBM Cloud.
    Mask = A way of limiting the amount of data returned from an API call.
